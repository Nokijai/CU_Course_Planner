The dynamic landscape of the global cultural scene, where culture converges with the economy, community, heritage, and innovative technologies, has created an impetus for many cities to adopt innovative approaches in utilising urban spaces and cultural resources, enabling citizens to vividly reimagine their urban and cultural life. These approaches are envisioned as and manifested in the form of the development of large-scale urban regions and city clusters, where major cultural facilities such as museums, art districts, performance venues, and festivals significantly contribute to social well-being and intercultural dialogue.This course is designed to provide students with an opportunity to explore the interface between culture, urban space, and the economy with an eye towards the radically changing cultural landscape of Hong Kong. By offering students both theoretical knowledge and firsthand field experience, this course examines museums, galleries, and various cultural institutions as exemplary cases of how different forms of cultural activities can be turned into powerhouses of creative synergies and economic growth.

Part of the crisis is caused by global trends toward financial and technological capitalism, but the other part of the problem has to be sought in the humanistic disciplines themselves. Over-specialization in research, fragmentation among and within disciplines, the pressure of utilitarian goals (such as grant-getting for faculty promotion and practical job-orientation for students) are but some of the manifestations obvious to all. How to remedy the situation? Short of an institutional overhaul, we might begin from our own academic base, humanities departments under the Faculty of Arts.From an academic point of view, over-specialization in the humanities departments results in scholars working in narrow and isolated fields without interaction with colleagues in other departments and fields. The study of China also suffers from such an academic trend, which results in fragmentary studies of narrowly defined topics that fail to connect with each other and with the larger background. A further problem, particularly evident in some humanities fields, is the over-reliance on Western theory, which is applied to Chinese data without reflection or mediation. Certain theoretical excesses, as exemplified in the work of Michel Foucault and other poststructuralist theorists, have led to a general distrust of the human subject itself.

This course introduces students to the exciting world of digital humanities, including text mining (text), digital analysis of images (image), and 3-D scanning and printing (object). These are skills that can be used to gain insights from texts written in Chinese, English and other languages, paintings, engravings or statuary, as well as historical artefacts. Students will be able to apply what they learn in this course to a range of questions in the humanities. It will also be useful in a variety of future careers in both the academic and applied humanities. This is an introductory postgraduate course and no background in digital humanities is required. The class will meet in the Digital Scholarship Lab of the University Library and will culminate in a group project (website) that students can add to their portfolios.", "outcome": " Reflect on the role of digital methods in humanities research Leverage the latest tools developed around the world and the resources available at CUHK for digital humanities research Learn a range of digital methods for humanities research applicable to a variety of fields (word-image-object), including specific computational methods borrowed from data science Apply those methods to specific humanities questions and assess their success Collaborate with other students to create a final project that leverages these methods", "syllabus": " What is Digital Humanities? \u00a0 Do the Humanities have Data?\u00a0 Interacting with Computers: Python Made Easy Word: Text Mining with CText I (Chinese) Word: Text Mining with CText II (Chinese) Word: NLP with CText (Chinese & English) Word: More NLP with Python (English & other languages) Image: Image Processing (Filters and Edge Detection) Image: Recognizing Images (Image Analysis) Image: Digital Art History in Action (Giuseppe Castiglione case study)\u00a0 Object: 3D Scanning\u00a0 Object: 3D Printing I Object: 3D Printing II Reflections & Final Project Troubleshooting\u00a0 \u00a0", "required_readings": "Mattingly, William.

Human activities have been drastically transforming the ecosystem. How do we in the humanities understand the changing nature, live with pollution, and make sense of ecological deterioration? How do technology, capital and state intertwine and contribute to climate changes and environmental crises? How do people in the humanities engage with issues of sustainability and environmental justice in everyday life? This course introduces major concerns in the field of environmental humanities through the lens of China, the \u201cWorld\u2019s Factory\u201d and the most populated country with the second largest economy, whose environmental challenges have great implications for the rest of the world. This course will first survey topics of scientific and technological intervention of our natural world in the Anthropocene era. It then looks at case studies of specific topics such as agricultural sustainability, waste management, water crisis, species extinction, and environmental justice. Each topic will contain one week discussion of the topic\u2019s global manifestations and related debates in China, and one week\u2019s introduction on humanities response to the issues. Students will be guided to develop critical understanding of our natural world and to develop innovative ideas and humanistic responses.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}]
