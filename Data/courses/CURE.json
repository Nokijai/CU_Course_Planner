and practices of public humanities, an emerging field that examines the influence of the humanities in the public sphere. It guides students through the ways in which humanistic thinking and inquiry can impact community engagement, collective cultural history and memory, policy-making, and the cultivation of empathy. Organized into three sections\u2014Visions, Paths, and Experiments\u2014each part focusing on different dimensions of public humanities, the course begins by exploring the conceptual foundations of public humanism, emphasizing the importance of curiosity, generosity, and collaboration. As the course progresses, students engage with real-world case studies that demonstrate how humanities initiatives can reshape culture and society. Students will also experiment with designing a small-scale collaborative project, which allows them to transform their public concerns and humanistic inquiries into concrete outcomes. These projects serve as a starting point for their further development within and beyond the programs of public humanities. The course is designed for students interested in leveraging the humanities to enrich public culture.", "outcome": "Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to:\u00a0 Analyze and Develop Public Humanities Projects:Evaluate and curate small-scale public humanities projects, understanding their impact on community engagement and public scholarship.\u00a0 Communicate Scholarly Research Effectively:Utilize digital platforms to articulate complex ideas in a clear, accessible manner, effectively reaching and engaging diverse audiences.\u00a0 Collaborate Effectively in Diverse Teams:Work collaboratively to integrate diverse perspectives, assess team dynamics critically, and manage project challenges efficiently.", "syllabus": "Part A: Visions\u00a0Week 1: Rethinking the Humanities for a Better Future Students will be introduced to the development of the humanities, focusing on the challenges in universities and exploring new directions.

Celebrity culture is generally understood as a cult full of short-lived trends and inconsequential fan behaviour. We seldom consider, however, the powerful influence it has over our cultural identities. This course examines how the interplay between celebrity culture and the cultural industry shapes cultural identity with case studies from Hong Kong as the major scope of study. Starting with a brief history of Hong Kong celebrity culture from the 1980s to the present day, the course offers an entry point for students to understand the intricate relationship between the media and celebrity culture, encompassing a wide range of cultural icons and phenomena such as action film actors, cross-media megastars, and YouTube micro-celebrities. Each case study will engage with key concepts in celebrity culture, such as star-text, commodification, authenticity, extratextual reading, and participatory reading. The course proceeds by introducing the critical perspective of cultural studies in making sense of representation politics, public culture, fandom studies, and the diverse modes of intimacy in the digital age. Overall, students will gain an understanding of celebrity culture and how identities are thus produced, promoted, and commodified in the wider arena of media and popular culture.", "outcome": " Upon completion of the subject, students will be able to:  Define and explain the connotation of celebrity culture, stardom, and popular culture in contemporary society, and the genealogy of discourses development of Hong Kong popular culture over time.

To do this, students will learn major theories and methods in the cultural study of health and medicine to understand how culture, power, and identity\u2014including race, gender, capitalism, and colonialism\u2014 shapes the management of disease and individual illness experience in both Asian and global contexts. A critical concern in this course is how the organization of medical care confronts questions of social justice in medical treatment and public health in historical and contemporary contexts. Students will also grapple with the question of whether our institutions of medicine and public health function as a form of social control. By introducing students to the social components of health and illness, it aims to foster cross-disciplinary conversations across the faculties of arts, medicine, and other divisions at CUHK.Following the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goal of Reducing Inequality (SDG #10), a central question in this course is how medical treatments, research, and public health confront, or fail to confront, issues of social justice in global contexts. Students will learn theoretical approaches to health and inequality to investigate how history, culture, and politics shape the illness experience of socially marginalized people. These theories will enable students to assess the strengths and limits of our current arrangements of medical care and approaches to global health. In addition, students will learn critical medical humanities methods, such as ethnography, and use these methods to propose solutions to our current shortcomings in health governance. This course will challenge students to imagine better alternatives to our unequal world and demonstrate why the study of culture matters in medicine, global health, and public policy.", "outcome": "-Analyze how social inequality shapes disease outcomes (SDG #10)-Explain how media shapes public understandings of health and disease, including stigma-Situate individual illness experience in the social, political, and cultural contexts of disease-Implement the use of ethnography to develop health policies that can reduce inequality (SDG #10)", "syllabus": "Introduction: Critical Medical HumanitiesIn this introductory class, students will learn about the critical medical humanities as a method for interrogating fundamental questions of social justice in medicine: who gets sick, who gets better, and why? Students will be introduced to basic theories and concepts in the cultural studies of health and disease, such as stigma, biopolitics, and illness discourse, as tools for analyzing the complex social forces that shape health disparities. In addition, students will be provided with a basic introduction to public health systems, as well as information about the places and time periods that will be covered in the course.\u00a0Unit One: Race and DiseaseThis unit starts with the histories of international disease control in Asian contexts, with emphasis on how social, cultural, and racial differences shaped the management of disease in colonial spaces. Students will analyze how issues of power and identity inform public health interventions, which often protects the privileged while stigmatizing and harming others. We will use the Hong Kong plague outbreak of 1894 as a case study in health inequity and learn, for example, about the homes of migrant Chinese labourers being burned by colonial officials in the name of disease control. We will conclude the unit by reflecting on how ideas of race and other forms social difference still shape the framing of disease even in contemporary discourses. Students will utilize cultural theories on race, gender, class, and inequality to identify how social biases shapes disease perception and response to reduce health inequality.1.\u00a0 Difference and Disease in Tropical MedicineKey themes: hygienic modernity, power/knowledge, the \u201cnative\u201d body, the laboratory in colonial discourse, vaccine politics2.\u00a0\u00a0Colonial Tensions in Hong Kong\u2019s Plague PandemicKey themes: race and space, epidemic orientalism, the politics of quarantine and sanitary regimes, germ theory vs. local knowledge\u00a03.\u00a0\u00a0Representing DiseaseKey themes: cultural representations of \u201cthe other\u201d in disease discourse, endemicity as a cultural concept, body politics, the role of media in shaping disease response, global healthUnit Two: The Politics of Identity in Medicine\u00a0Why are doctors often men? Why do doctors often come from socially dominant groups in terms of ethnicity and class privilege? What are the implications for how medicine is practiced? This unit offers answers to some of these questions by exploring the power structures that shape our institutions of medicine. We start with examining the social power of physicians. Students will learn about the social factors that shape how medical conditions come to be recognized, and the populations that are excluded or harmed in the pursuit of medical advancement. By understanding the politics of identity in medicine, students will gain the conceptual tools for understanding the health disparities that result when medicine often reflects the interests of socially dominant groups. Course discussions will invite students to apply concepts learned in this unit to address health disparities here in Hong Kong, where ethnic minorities representing 8.4% of the population face barriers in accessing care,\u00a0mental health resources are not yet able to address demand, and a fragile public health system offers diminished care for the city\u2019s neediest.4. Physician Power\u00a0Key themes: medicalization, normal vs. pathological, social control, illness narrative5. Medical ExperimentationKey themes: medical mistrust, medical gaze, ethical variation, biopolitics, bare life\u00a06. Gender and Medicine IKey themes: gender discrimination in medicine, bias in clinical research, androcentrism, experiential knowledge, situated knowledge7. Gender and Medicine IIKey themes: patient activism, advocacy, biosociality, online communities\u00a0Unit Three: Medicine, Power, and Structural Violence\u00a0In this final unit, we will connect individual illness experiences to the broader social, economic, and structural factors that result in ill health, such as poverty, uneven development, forced migration, and others. This unit will emphasize the illness experiences of marginalized social groups to examine the effects of social, political, and economic disenfranchisement on their bodies and health. By examining health and illness at the level of everyday life, students will develop an understanding of how ethnographic methods can be used to make interventions in health policy. In the concluding week, we will wrap up with a discussion about who benefits, and who may be harmed, in our current global health system and propose ways to align global health priorities with the principles health justice.8. Structural Violence and Health DisparitiesKey themes: structural violence, embodiment, subjectivity, illness narrative, decolonization9.

This will allow us not only to realize literature as the principal record of Taoist tradition in its confirmation and valorization of Taoist values, but also to grapple with the literary challenge to inherited orthodoxies and thus the undermining of conventional ideas and feelings, as well as to sample the texture of literature functioning as an alternative or substitute for Taoism.

In addition, this section presents an open system approach to understanding a cultural organization, which interacts with the external environment. Museums and theaters are used as two cases to study the structure of a cultural organization.

The popularity of the word reflects the growing importance of assembling, managing and presenting data and collection, a process of gathering information that brings maximum value relevant to different audiences.In this context, this course is designed to provide students with an opportunity to learn about both historical and contemporary examples of how culture is understood through exhibition design and curating. By covering various forms of curatorial traditions, disruptive ideas, and emergent digital practices in the ever-expanding field of curation, this course equips students with the ability to question what they take for granted and reflect on existing issues conducive to different cultures, values and beliefs. By the end of the course, students will be able to critically examine how knowledge is created inside and outside of art institutions and how curation could potentially become public knowledge.", "outcome": "Upon completing this course, students will be able to:\u00a0\u2022 Explain key historical and contemporary examples of exhibition design and curating, relating to a wider local and global context\u00a0\u2022 Examine critical issues concerning ways that different cultures, values and beliefs are represented through curation\u00a0\u2022 Develop skills to critically analyze how knowledge is created inside and outside art institutions\u00a0\u2022 Acquire personal and social competencies to transfer curating into knowledge sharing and act as an active agent in facilitating knowledge engagement \u00a0\u2022 Develop an attitude of innovation and creativity by challenging assumptions in the ever-expanding field of curation", "syllabus": "Major concept/topics\u00a01) A brief history of curating and exhibition making\u00a0\u2022 Graham, B.

How do we understand and connect to animal kingdom?How do human-animal connections shape modern culture and society?How do cultural studies and humanities expand our scope on animal and nature?Culture is ordinary, in Raymond William\u2019s saying, but the ordinariness is merely treated as a reflection of human everyday life. Although cultural studies has sustained concern on everyday life with mass production, consumerism, sexism, racism and postmodernism, the discipline always lags behind the concern of nature and animal species. As the issues of animal abuse, environmental protection, factory farming, animal protection policy and law-making, as well as media various portrayals being the hot topics of our (post)modern world, the study of animal with the perspective of cultural studies and other humanity disciplines can explore the possibilities of better human-animal relationship. This course is designed with an empathic concern of other-than-human animals. By exploring different issues of human and animals\u2019 life, this course looks for a harmonious balance of nature and modern culture.This course focuses on three areas, through which we can explore the different aspects of animal and cultural studies. These areas are:A. Entering Jurassic Park \u2013 Remaking Animals in Leisure (Lecture A1-A4)B. Attacking Godzilla \u2013 Representing Animals in Media (Lecture B1-B4)C. Finding Nemo \u2013 Revitalizing Animals in the City  (Lecture C1-C4)Each area covers a set of animal issue discussion. Area A, apart from theorizing animal with cultural studies, tackles the basic animal issues: pet-nurturing, zoo-building, forest-sustaining and tourism. This is to provide a foundation for understanding animals with a critical reflection of everyday life. Area B, set with the concern of media, discusses issues of animal representation in cartoon, cinema, literature and journalism. This is to read how animals would be represented and how this affects human understanding and related policy-making. A screening will be run after Lecture Area B. This is to provide an alternative understanding of animal representation in popular media. Area C further deals with the matters of animal-city relationship in seeing how dogs and cats, cattle and swine, and fishes and dolphins are (mal)treated in the street, the farm and the sea respectively. This is to end the course with a leading thought of perfect balance of nature and modernity; and more queries of human-animal relationship will be raised for contemplation.", "outcome": " Learning Outcomes: On successful completion of the course, students are expected to be able to:  Explain the concern of other-than-human animal with cultural studies perspective;  Identify the key issues and critical assessment of human-animal relationship;  Understand the approach in studying culture, animal and environment;  Enrich the angle of analyzing human living and animal species.", "syllabus": " Area A\u00a0 Entering Jurassic Park \u2013 Remaking Animals in Leisure Week 1.

Thus, this course aims to introduce contemporary art and its representational aesthetics to consider various socio-cultural issues regarding art circulation and its interpretation, the connotation of contemporary art in society. The works of various contemporary artists will be presented in the context of focal issues that invoke social practices, conventional modality of contemporary art scene, shifting art interpretation within the norms and values in a society, relational art and public engagement, experimental use of media. In each week we will analyze contemporary art with specific themes, emphasizing the recurrent motifs and issues in contemporary art and its politics of representation, such as situation and activism, space, ruin and urbanity/modernity, trauma and memory in history, animality and non-human subjectivity, post-human and prosthetic body, gender and sexuality, queer art, magic (the material culture of the weird and eerie, ghost and monstrous iconography), cuteness as a concept reflecting from the contemporary popular cultural reference.

Meanwhile, many Chinese translations of the Bible are heavily influenced by the Chinese cultural and literary traditions.

It also introduces the concept of virtual reality, which has been widely applied in both two and three-dimensional work. \u00a0\u00a04.Films and Animations \u00a0This lecture continues the last one in discussing the idea of realism and representation in media production. This one focuses on the images reproduced in films and video games. It discusses the theories employed in photography and filming with digital devices that lead students to think how the new technologies alter the traditional views about representation. \u00a0\u00a05.Economy and the Web Media \u00a0The New Media is often regarded as being reasonably economical in operation, compared with other traditional means of presentation. This lecture discusses the economic aspects of using different web engines and forums, as well as the commercial limits in employing those devices. \u00a0\u00a06. Wikis and Web 2.0 \u00a0Web 2.0 is a concept introduced at the beginning of this century to describe the combination of software (HTML), hardware, and Internet in forming a major sector of social interaction.

Community art serves as a tool for community development, based on the understanding that expression, mastery and communication through the arts powerfully encode cultural values, thus bringing deeper meanings of experience, participation and involvement, sense of belonging to the general public and the community. This course aims to advance students\u2019 understanding of public and community arts by embedding them in the theoretical discussions and critiques of cities and public spaces and practical experiences. It also imparts the knowledge and skills about managing public arts and actualizing community art programs, and discusses the way to support their development responding to the needs.", "outcome": "In terms of knowledge acquisition, students are expected to understand how public and community arts emerged in the context of urban regeneration and community activist movements. Students are encouraged to critically analyze the meanings and social values of public art spaces. In terms of managerial concepts and skills, students will learn how public and community arts are supported by government policies, material resources, infrastructure and training. Students are expected to understand public art commission and reception, to master basic principles of utilizing public art as an urban design strategy, and to apply varying approaches to facilitating community art development, for example, advancing community art education, utilizing the cultural planning approach to assess community based cultural resources and the place-event approach to creating a sense of community attachment.", "syllabus": "Part I. Understanding Public and Community Art\u00a01. General Introduction\u00a0This section begins with displaying a range of public and community art cases and presents an introduction to the course. Three issues are covered in this introductory lecture. First, this section provides the conceptual discussions of public space, public art, and their art forms to enable students to understand what public art space and public art is. Second, this section explores the role of artists in public art space and community development. Third, a historical picture of public art is unfolded, which traces its origin, displays its developing process, and takes a glimpse into its enshrined social values. \u00a0\u00a02. Understanding Public Art Spaces \u00a0How should we understand public art spaces and the public nature of public art? This section embeds these issues into the understanding of a city; it then conveys the ideas that public spaces are socially produced and that city forms are imbued with ideologies. Public art stems from an urban setting and then grows through the urban regeneration movement, which comprises several issues, such as urban image, urban form and urban planning as well as their connections with public art space as a form of representational space. Furthermore, this section explores the public nature of public art by examining the process, by which artists derive value from individual creativity in the studios and immense it into the public space. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss the alternative history of public art (Lacy, 1995, 25\u201328).\u00a0\u00a03. Public Art: The Monument\u00a0The monument is an important theoretical perspective to conceptualize public art. This section explains what a \u201cmonument\u201d is and investigates its role\u2014whether statue, memorial, or public statue\u2014in upholding a value-laden system of Western society. Issues under examination range from the connection between monument and national identity, the power and representation of public arts, the transformative understanding of public art as a monument, and the contradictions of public art. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss the public nature of public art.\u00a0\u00a04. Critical Issues of Public Art Spaces\u00a0Who comprise the \u201caudience\u201d of public arts? What does \u201cintention\u201d mean and what is the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of public art? This section further discusses the theories on critical issues related to public art. This section begins with the discussions of the relevant terms and proceeds to various critical thoughts that challenge the value of public art and question its public nature. Students are expected to be able to analyze public art spaces and public art critically.\u00a0Tutorial: Develop critical thinking about public art spaces and public art.\u00a0\u00a05. Public Arts and Community Cultural Development: Theoretical Underpinnings of Community Art\u00a0This section provides a synopsis of the histories and theoretical issues of community art. The origin of community art is traced to the discourse of William Morris\u2019s call for social reintegration of artists and a revival of art in the 19th century. Theoretical issues include the \u201cpopular front\u201d and class consciousness, civil rights and identity politics, as well as cultural democracy and exchange. In addition, this section discusses the definitions of community, the role of community art, and the core purposes of community development. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss the question, \u201cWhat makes art valuable?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0Part II. Public Art Management \u00a06. Commission and Reception of Public Art\u00a0Based on the public nature of art, this section analyzes the process of art making, which comprises the elements of audience, context, and meaning. The process includes the following: acquiring cultural approval, arriving in public sites and places, providing visiting experiences with the audience, and generating meanings. Cases of Seattle and New York are used for this study. With regard to art reception, it analyzes the issues of taste, the education of the audience, as well as the relationship of art to society and popular visual culture. In addition, this section also distinguishes performance culture from monumental public art.\u00a0Tutorial: Distinguish public art from community art.\u00a0\u00a07. Public Art and Urban Design\u00a0This section presents an urban design approach to commissioning and making public art. It outlines the principles for creating a city image, which consists of five elements, and discusses their connections to public art. Various forms of public art in association with the urban setting and the mechanism of public art utilization as an urban design strategy are also discussed. Students are guided toward understanding the role of public arts in urban design guidelines. Moreover, we also discussed a set of design principles on the relationship between public art and various urban forms and spatial components, aimed at integrating public art into the urban setting as context and reference is discussed.\u00a0Tutorial: Conduct design software training. \u00a0Assignment: Find a sample of public art (i.e., sculpture) using design principles to assess its location, site, and designs as well as to evaluate its strengths and weaknesses. Write a paper based on the research and use the design software to illustrate the arguments. \u00a0\u00a08. Government Policies for Public and Community Art Development\u00a0The relation between power and public and community art is a critical issue in public and community art management. This section discusses the governmental structure that funds and commissions public art, the infrastructure that underpins public art, and the governmental policies that support community art. The selection of commissions and projects is discussed, along with the process of seeking public and professional responses. International and the local Hong Kong contexts are examined to explore how government policies affect public and community art. In the local context, the role of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department in promoting public art in Hong Kong is adopted as a case study.\u00a0Tutorial: Conduct an in-class test. \u00a0\u00a09. Public Art in Metropolitan Cities\u00a0This section analyzes the role of public art in metropolitan cities, especially in the spheres of public transport, public open spaces, and public health system. A number of cases are presented, including forms of public art in the New York Subway system, London Underground and Mass Transit Railway, and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Hong Kong. The issue of commissioning public arts is revisited in the public art in metropolitan context. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss urban design and public art in Hong Kong.\u00a0\u00a0Part III. Community Art Management\u00a010. Developmental Needs of the Field\u00a0How can community art development be supported? What do communities need? This section specifies the scope of cultural policies and the policy climate that community artists and community cultural development require. Moreover, this section discusses the material support that community cultural organizations and artists need, including funding supports and internal infrastructure and exchange.\u00a0Tutorial: Discuss the cultural policies for public art in Hong Kong.\u00a0\u00a011. From Theory to Practice I: Process to Develop Community Arts\u00a0From theory to practice, this section offers students a general orientation, which serves as a road map to the community-based art process. Five conceptual territories to advance community-based art as well as requisite techniques to fulfill tasks are introduced in this section, which include the following: 1) contacting people in the community; 2) conducting research on the culture of the community and the people\u2019s perception of their community; 3) taking actions to make art projects; 4) gaining feedbacks from the community; and 5) incorporating these art forms into community art education programs to pass on skills and sustain the impact. The program also includes strategies for planning and organizing community outreach and engagement programs as well as ways to enhance public awareness.\u00a0Tutorial: Discuss the process of applying theories in the creation of community art in order to practice and initiate the group project with the community.\u00a0\u00a012. From Theory to Practice II: Key Issues in Community Art Development\u00a0Based on the holistic picture of the steps to develop community arts, this section focuses on certain key and challenging issues in the process, specifically those on research methods and art making. The section introduces qualitative and quantitative research methods for the project of community art development, and students are expected to learn how to identify survey areas, design survey questionnaires, run group discussions, and map cultural mind-sets and assets. Another key issue is how to make arts and work with artists. An artist will be invited to be the guest speaker to give the lesson.\u00a0Tutorial: Develop a group project with the community. \u00a0\u00a013. Review and discussions\u00a0Students will present their on-going group projects on community art development, and the professor then provides comments and feedbacks on their projects. Key points of this course will also be reviewed in this class.", "required_readings": "Goldbard, A., 2006, New Creative Community: The Art of Cultural Development, Oakland, CA: New Village Press. \u00a0Grogan, D., Mercer, C. and Engwicht, D., 1996, The Cultural Planning Handbook, St. Leonards, N.S.W.: Allen & Unwin,\u00a0Harris, S.

It includes a wide range of perspectives, from Eurocentric to post-colonial, with an increasing focus on living culture that intertwines global and local narratives. This field involves diverse interpretive lenses, public discourse, human rights issues, and a shift from mere observation to immersive experiences. The interpretations of cultural heritage are shaped by numerous stakeholders, including educators, public program participants, researchers, writers, designers, creatives, consultants, curators, scientists, and historians. In recent years, technological advancements have further enhanced the use of digital media and social networking in cultural heritage, fostering new connections between visitors and heritage. Consequently, the interpretation of cultural heritage remains dynamic and fluid, embracing a variety of approaches and philosophies.This course aims to provide students with a broad knowledge of cultural heritage interpretations and the theoretical frameworks that offer different lenses and approaches for thinking about cultural heritage. It covers various types of cultural heritage, the role of storytelling in heritage interpretation, heritage as public discourse, identity issues, visitor engagement and education, tourism, community involvement, and ethical issues. Additionally, this course will examine how technology plays a role in engaging audiences and facilitating interpretations. By offering students diverse concepts of cultural heritage interpretations, they will gain a comprehensive understanding of current interpretive approaches, emerging trends, and innovations in the interpretation of heritage.", "outcome": " Explore key approaches, philosophies, and theories of cultural heritage interpretation.

Think critically about museum exhibitions and other cultural events.", "syllabus": "1 Introduction:What is a museum? \u00a0The introduction gives an overview of the museum structure and definition. This will introduce the various types of museums established around the world, defined according to the range of their collections. This will also compare the organization structure of a museum, in which the curatorial teams are working with a range of specialists relevant. \u00a0\u00a02 The history of museums \u00a0The \u2018history\u2019 of museum sounds alien to the context of museum studies. But museum workers are coming to beware that the museums are products of modernity that marked a distinctive times in which antiquities could be treated as shared, public properties. This lecture reviews the establishments of the Louvre and the British Museum in the 18th century; and discusses how \u2018museums\u2019 were contextualized first in Japan and later on in China. \u00a0\u00a03 Curatorship I: Exhibiting Authenticity and Interpretation\u00a0As the last lecture recalls, \u2018Museum as Ritual\u2019 has become an established social understanding\u2014museum is a place where esteemed objects are being exhibited and therefore recognized. The first problem that encounters all museum works is whether the objects they are showing, or the theme of the objects that they are presenting are \u2018authentic\u2019. In this lecture, we will look at examples of some early colonial museums and study the created themes that they presented. \u00a0\u00a04 Curatorship II: Organizing a thematic exhibition\u00a0Putting up a thematic exhibition (alongside the permanent exhibition) is a common practice in most museums. This lecture will give instructions as to what elements a thematic show should include. Then students are organized into groups to do a role play session for three parties: museum workers, overseas collaborators, and the donors. From this exercise, students will learn about the difficulties in negotiations and planning. \u00a0\u00a05 Curatorship III: Museum publications and cultural writings\u00a0The writings published for the museums share a common theme of identifying the artistic or historical values of the objects. In practice, however, there are various levels in addressing objects through literary practices. This lecture will look into some representative examples written for different targeted groups, which include children, pupils, and foreign visitors. \u00a0\u00a06 Museum and society I: Architecture and Design\u00a0Renovation projects were undertaken in numerous renowned museums around the world, because it has become aware that museums have to catch up with young generations and with the rapidly developed cities, in which they are located. This lecture will look into the case of Doha Quarter, where the locals took a deliberate attempt to a museum compound. From such we will consider the significance of architecture and museum collection. \u00a0\u00a07 Museum and society II: Education and Application of Digital Technology \u00a0Smartphones and other technological devices have become useful sources for museum presentations and visits. This lecture reviews some applications both within the museum building and outside it. The lecture will also respond to the concerns that digital technologies may exhaust public interests in the museum collections. With these both sides of argument, this lecture leads students to consider both the usefulness and shortcomings of digital technologies. \u00a0\u00a08 Museum and society III: Patrons, Donors and Volunteers, the sources of Funding and Support\u00a0Funding is always limited for cultural institutions. In this lecture, we will discuss the various potential fund sources for the museums. There is no standard way in the industry as to what the museum workers should do or write to apply for funding. But there are recognized sources about which they could get in touch: public visitors, membership programmes, volunteers, donars, and governmental resources. The key of the lecture is to develop an open mind to expand the coverage of funding from monetary values to public recognition. \u00a0\u00a09 Current issue I: Museum Branding and Marketing\u00a0Museum branding has been identified as a major marketing strategy for cultural institution. In this lecture, we will look at the suggestions of some successful museum workers and study their marketing approaches by creating a brand for museums. \u00a0\u00a010 Current issue II: Soft Power and the Political Roles of Museums.\u00a0As soon as Joseph Nye published his idea about soft power, which is based on the dissemination of cultural products or ideas, the discussion is always concerned with museum exhibitions. Museums could be taken as political statement of national treasures. In this lecture, we will discuss the ideas of Nye and look at how such concept has been interpreted in Asia. \u00a0\u00a011 Fieldtrip/site visit week \u00a0This week we will take some fresh air by visiting a local museum/site. \u00a0\u00a012 Current issue III: Museums and Contemporary Arts. \u00a0Should we include contemporary art in the context of museum? This is a difficult question that happens to most museums around the world. The well-used resolution is construction of a new venue dedicated to contemporary arts. The differences between the two disciplines\u2014museums and contemporary arts\u2014are related to the level of curatorship and public recognition. But the two themes seem to have blurred since the last decade. \u00a0\u00a013 Current issue IV: M+ and other museums in Hong Kong\u00a0In this last session, we will return our discussion to Hong Kong and look at what options this city has in comparison from what we have seen in other parts of the world. The M+ is dedicated to contemporary arts, or experimental arts; but the local museums remain fairly traditional in terms of collection and their range of exhibitions. Can Hong Kong develop a cultural hub? If so, what roles do these institutes would play?", "required_readings": "Topic 1: \u00a01. Burcaw, chapters 1 and 3. \u00a0\u00a0Topic 2:\u00a01.

Instead of treating Benjamin, Adorno, Hall, and Grossberg as representative of the corpus of theory, it engages with prevailing discussions in Postcolonial Studies, Modernity/Coloniality, and Black Studies. It moves beyond the call for \u2018de-Westernization\u2019 by looking at theoretical texts and frameworks produced in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The course concludes by exploring work about indigeneity, memory, and environmentalism. The course is designed for advanced undergraduates with familiarity in critical approaches to literature, cinema, art, and media. Classes will grapple with the following questions: What qualifies as theory? Is theory necessarily abstract? What is the relationship of theory to particularity and difference? How can theory be made more attune to its contexts of production, dissemination, and application? How can film and visual art offer sources for theorizing? How might theoretical frameworks respond more significantly to social, economic, and environmental conditions from the restructuring of the capitalist system, expansion of media networks, dissolution of national borders, and deterioration of the climate crisis?", "outcome": "The objectives are: \u00a0 To become acquainted with theoretical texts and frameworks in Cultural Studies by marginalized voices from different peripheral social and geographic contexts To apply theory to analyze the articulation of race, gender, memory, and nature in literature, cinema, art, and media To formulate, develop, write, and revise an original critical essay using global cultural theories\u00a0", "syllabus": "Week 1: How to Theorize Culture?Week 2: Postcolonialism Week 3: Modernity/ColonialityWeek 4: GenderWeek 5: RaceWeek 6: Migration and MobilityWeek 7: Media PhilosophyWeek 8: Memory and TraumaWeek 9: IndigeneityWeek 10: Ecology and the Non-Human", "required_readings": " Frantz Fanon, \u201cThe So-Called Dependency Complex of the Colonized,\u201d in Black Skin, White Masks (1952; New York: Penguin, 2019), pp. 64-8 Paul Gilroy, \u201c\u2018Jewels Brought from Bondage\u2019: Black Music and the Politics of Authenticity,\u201d in Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness (London: Verso, 1993), pp. 72-110\u00a0 Lawrence Grossberg, \u201cThe Heart of Cultural Studies,\u201d in Cultural Studies in the Future Tense (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2010), pp. 7-30 Judith Halberstam, \u201cLow Theory,\u201d in The Queer Art of Failure (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2006), pp. 1-25 Laura Marks, \u201cThe Memory of Touch,\u201d in The Skin of the Film: Intercultural Cinema, Embodiment, and the Senses (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2000), pp. 127-193 Boaventura de Sousa Santos, \u201cCreating a Distance in Relation\u00a0 to Western-centric Political Imagination\u00a0 and Critical Theory,\u201d Epistemologies of the South: Justice Against Epistemicide (New York: Routledge, 2014), pp. 19-46 Silvia Rivera Cuscaniqui, \u201cCh'ixinakax utxiwa: A Reflection on the Practices and Discourses of Decolonization,\u201d South Atlantic Quarterly 111, no. 1 (2012): 95-109 Teri J.

The aim of the course is to show that pornography is a not a unified screen culture but consists of varied representations within cultural contexts. The course will teach students how to analyze these representations and how to take into account their cultural histories. The course will take a Cultural Studies approach and examine within specific cultural environments and include the positions of anti-porn and pro-porn activists. Therefore students will get an overview of diverging perspectives while being encouraged to consider their own values and critical responses. Students will be asked to respond to theories and audio-visual examples, while actively partaking in debates about pornography and its impact on religion, gender, sexuality, health, labor and economy. Finally, the course will pay special importance to how contemporary sexually explicit media are impacting new user groups such young adult netizens, female consumers, disabled people, as well as ethnic and sexual minorities. Students will carry out a major assignment while learning how to apply ethnographic research methods to analyze representations of the body and sexuality within screen cultures. In this assignment, they will focus on a media environment/platform and a sexual culture of their choice to find out how culture is being redefined and visualized by media users. Two workshops will be organized in the media lab in order to train the students in different methods and perspectives on digital ethnographyLanguage of instruction: Classes and assignments will be carried out in the English language and students\u2019 active participation in both lectures and tutorials will be required. Students can carry out ethnographic fieldwork in Cantonese or any language of your choice, but need to present the results in English.Learning Activities: Students are required to attend a 3-hour class each week. The course combines theoretical lectures with the viewing of films and media examples. There will also be tutorial sessions each week based on the lectures and on the weekly readings. All students are required to post weekly reflections on Blackboard and to participate in discussions.

Successful culture managers work to maintain healthy balance between culture and its relevant fields of interests, which sometimes could turn harmful or beneficial to the growth and development of the corresponding cultural area. The first session discusses the mutual dependence between culture and various areas, which include laws, economy, community, national interests, and art practitioners. In practice, cultural managers usually have to conform to the values and ethnics of the corresponding countries. For that reason, the second session will look at the approach taken in a few remarkable examples, which Taiwan, China, Singapore, South Korea, U.K., and the U.S.", "outcome": "Upon completion of the course, students will be able to explain different national and social concerns for preserving culture; to identify the legal and ethnic issues relevant to cultural productions; to identify marketing strategies in cultural promotion; to evaluate the measures for maximizing the input of art practitioners; and to describe the various successful cultural schemes implemented in overseas countries.", "syllabus": "Section I: Culture in Context \u00a0\u00a01. Culture & States\u00a0The growth of cultural industries is strongly related to political environment and state policy. This lecture discusses the tension and mutual expectations between cultural workers and politicians. It will use the experience of the European Union and the US as examples. \u00a0\u00a02. Culture & Laws\u00a0Over the last few decades, there were a number of remarkable disputes over international art transactions and copy rights. Given the growing size of the art market, knowledge about the previous cases is essential. This lecture takes the examples taken from the US for discussions. \u00a0\u00a03. Culture & UNESCO\u00a0UNESCO is arguably a rising new power in forming a standard for evaluating cultural heritage of different nations. This lecture discusses the roles of UNESCO and its work in different cultural disciplines. National disputes over ownership of World Heritage sites will be bought up. \u00a0\u00a04. Culture & Community\u00a0Nowadays many nations and countries perceive culture and heritage as means to empower developing communities. This lecture discusses the conservation of indigenous or minorities cultures, and its impacts on the majority population of the same community. \u00a0\u00a05. Culture & Marketing \u00a0Culture and business are often taken as two contrasting disciplines. One of the key issues in cultural management is to develop cultural audience with both education and economic concerns. Religious sectors are a growing body of cultural venues for tourism and heritage management. This lecture discusses the debated concerns about conducting marketing or business-driven strategies in cultural and religious areas. \u00a0\u00a0Section II: Case Studies\u00a06. Cultural Management in Taiwan\u00a0Taiwan provides an excellent example to demonstrate the top-down organization of heritage sites. This lecture reviews a series of campaigns launched in Taiwan during the past twenty years, and discusses the reasons that may have contributed to engage the mass of Taiwan into different aspects of cultural industries. \u00a0\u00a07. Cultural Management in China\u00a0China represents many upcoming opportunities in cultural management. This lecture reviews some recent moves: rapid establishment of museums, growing number of commercial galleries and auction houses, rise of new Confucian schools, introduction of university degrees in cultural management, etc. The lecture discusses the consuming force underneath the cultural growth in the Mainland. \u00a0\u00a08. Cultural Management in Singapore\u00a0During the last two decades, the government of Singapore invested heavily on constructing cultural venues for both national and economic purposes. This lecture gives an overview of their establishment and invites students to reflect on the opportunities found in other areas of Asia. \u00a0\u00a09. Cultural Management in South Korea\u00a0This lecture discusses the contemporary cultural policies undertaken in South Korea. During the last decade, South Korea featured an economic miracle in Asia by rejuvenating the distressed financial market with cultural developments, which included the film industry, heritage protection, publication, and cultural tourism. \u00a0\u00a010. Cultural Management in UK\u00a0The United Kingdom was one of the earliest countries that invested heavily on promotion of cultural and arts events. This lecture gives a short history of the early developments made in the UK after the Second World War, and discusses the recent campaigns undertaken to break the boundaries between high arts and popular culture. \u00a0\u00a011. Cultural Management in USA\u00a0The United States distinguishes herself from all other countries by boosting the absence of a ministry for arts and culture, yet artists and cultural workers receive due respects for their contributions. This lecture looks at the case of the US and examines her success in cultural management. \u00a0\u00a012. Group presentation\u00a0This lecture is taken as a mock symposium for students to present their group projects and make comments on those by their peers. The presentation will be evaluated against the clarity and thoughts over the approved topics. \u00a0\u00a013. Conclusion: What is the best for Hong Kong? \u00a0This last session will summarize the topics covered throughout the course. Hong Kong is facing the challenge that many aspects of cultural developments in relation to urban planning, legislation, economy, national identity, and education are all pending. This lecture is an open discussion for students to brainstorm the possible approaches that Hong Kong could take in years to come.", "required_readings": "Week 1\u00a0Rosenstein, Carole. \u2018 Cultural policy and the political nature of culture\u2019 in J.P.

It comprises three blocks: Block 1 unfolds an overall picture of the phenomenon, introduces the related concepts, displays the disciplinary foundation of this topic, traces its history, and discusses the rationales and developing tendency. Block 2 studies the urban sociological and economic approaches employed in developing the theoretical foundation, highlighting a transition in capitalist production mode and urban governance upheld by public-private partnership modes. Criticisms are also presented to complete a dialectic mindset of this phenomenon. With a strong practical dimension, Block 3 teaches students various methods to make consultancy and policy recommendations for culture-led urban development projects. A variety of practices that constitute the culture-led strategy are discussed, such as how to plan for a creative city and cultural facilities, how to boost creative industries and develop cultural quarters and creative clusters, as well as how to revitalize historic quarters.", "outcome": "Students are introduced to the basic concept of the culture-led urban development phenomenon, recognizing related concepts, understanding its history, and developing tendencies in the world. Then, they can gain a deep theoretical understanding of the origins of these practices in a capitalist political economic transition, the corresponding urban policies, and the urban governance modes. Moreover, students can learn how to conduct policy analysis and apply urban planning and design principles to provide consultancy for culture-led city development projects. The final products of group projects shall consist of policy recommendations and project consultancies for the Hong Kong government or other private sector developers.", "syllabus": "Part 1: Introduction to the Culture-led City Development Phenomenon\u00a01. Culture-led City Development: A Topic of Popularity\u00a0With a glimpse into a number of cities in Europe, America, and Asia that have implemented culture-led urban regeneration strategies, this lecture aims to spark the students\u2019 initial interest in this global phenomenon. This lecture identifies the disciplinary foundations of the topic\u2014from cultural studies, economic geography, and urban sociology to urban planning and design. Furthermore, this lecture examines the concept of culture in the culture-led city development phenomenon, emphasizing the increasing importance of culture in the related disciplines in the mindset of \u201cculture determining.\u201d The role of culture in generating profits, jobs, and other economic returns, being interwoven with local governance and identity is discussed. \u00a0\u00a02. Concepts, History, Rationale, and Debate\u00a0This section introduces a set of concepts closely related to that of \u201cculture-led city development,\u201d such as \u201ccities of culture,\u201d \u201cproperty-led development\u201d and \u201cculture-led regeneration,\u201d and differentiates the nuances among these concepts. The theories that argue for the role of culture in city formation and urban development are discussed, in which culture is viewed as resource or capital leading to symbolic economy that valorizes cities. A related issue is the role of cultural planning, which offers the resources and the framework in the process. The other theoretical source under scrutiny in this section is the importance of city or an urban environment to the growth of culture and cultural consumption. The writings of Jane Jacobs, Sharon Zukin, and Grame Evans are introduced. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss selected readings. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Part 2: Urban Sociological and Economic Approach to Understanding Culture-led Urban Regeneration\u00a03. Politics, Cultural Policies, and Culture-led City Development Strategies \u00a0This section explores the theoretical foundation of the culture-led city development phenomenon within the context of political economy. The transition of the capitalist production mode from Fordist economy to market-led post-Fordist economy has led to corresponding transitions in urban policies and urban governance modes, as well as to the adoption of public-private partnership. Culture-led city development strategy is a strategy, which is in line with the entrepreneurial urban policies. In addition, this section examines the connection between the culture-led city development strategies and the transformed cultural policies in cities. The broadening of the policy focus from art amenity provision to cultural economy development and urban cultural spaces planning has been identified as the most important policy context. Three stages of culture-led urban regeneration in terms of policies are also explained in detail. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss selected readings.\u00a0\u00a04. Economy of Culture and Arts in Cities \u00a0This section discusses the economic importance of culture and arts in cities. Culture is viewed as a new driver in urban economic growth, and the cultural sector is viewed as an indicator of urban economic growth. The economic importance of culture is associated with the so-called \u201csymbolic economy\u201d in cities, which involves upgrading urban images and boosting cultural consumption (e.g., urban tourism) within specific urban economies. Cultural and creative industries are the other main focal points of this lecture; thus, the geographic dimensions of cultural and creative industries are explored in this section. Furthermore, this lecture elaborates on the characteristics of cultural industry businesses and organizations, the geographic distribution of networks, and their production and consumption modes. Finally, a method to measure cultural and creative industries in cities is introduced. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss selected readings. \u00a0\u00a05. Culture-led Urban Regeneration Regimes and Cultural Strategies\u00a0Bianchini divides cultural culture-led city development strategies into culture-production-led and culture-consumption-led regeneration approaches. This section explores four types of production-led regeneration regimes and the consumption-led regime mode; cultural strategies and their interactions with modes of cultural production are also discussed. In addition, this section addresses the question of whether cultural strategies affect the conditions of cultural production. Finally, a method to fund cultural strategies is studied.\u00a0Tutorial: Discuss selected readings. \u00a0\u00a06. Urban Governance and Partnership Modes in Culture-led City Development \u00a0What are the urban governance modes that match individual culture-led city development practices? The transformation of urban governance and partnership modes, which is a response to the change in the capitalist production mode, is an important issue in understanding of culture-led urban development practices. Partnership is not simply a transition from managerial to entrepreneurial form but a public sector-led management to local public-private partnership to manage their opportunities effectively in the global economic background. This section explores the characteristics of urban governance and public-private partnership. This knowledge can be applied in creating cultural quarters, CCJQs, and cultural facilities in Block 3. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss selected readings.\u00a0\u00a07. Critiques on Culture-led Urban Regeneration\u00a0Culture-led urban development strategies result in positive urban outcomes; however, they can also have negative impacts. This section presents the criticisms against culture-led urban development. For example, designation and zoning of cultural quarters often lead to the gentrification effect that cuts off poor artists from industrial studios. Flagship cultural facilities have a high chance of failure, often resulting in social exclusion and economic inequality and trigger tensions between cultural diversity and cultural hegemony. Moreover, the contribution of cultural projects to employment and GDP is questioned.\u00a0Tutorial: Discuss selected readings. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Part 3: Strategies and Mechanisms for Practice: Policies, Urban Planning, and Design Tools\u00a08. Cultural Planning and Creative Cities \u00a0This section introduces the concept of \u201ccultural planning\u201d as well as its goals, principles, and rationale for practice. The major steps for practice are discussed briefly. The second issue in this lecture is related to creative city and creative milieu. Based on the concept of \u201ccreative city\u201d introduced in CUMT1001, this lecture discusses the principles and methods to create a creative milieu for a city. Further discussions are based on the insights of Landry regarding the components of creative cities and Hall about the characteristics and preconditions for the creation of creative cities. \u00a0Mid-term Test\u00a0\u00a09. Boosting Cultural and Creative Industries in Cities \u00a0This section discusses a method of using policy and planning tools to boost cultural and creative industries in cosmopolitan cities. First, the three stages of cultural industry development in connection with cultural policy transformations in history are reviewed. Second, a method is introduced, by which policies for cultural and creative industry development can be designed and initiated. Sophisticated analyses of local resources of arts, cultural industries and their interconnections, along with production chain linkage and planning assessment, comprise the key steps in creating effective policy designs. The geographic convergence of cultural businesses and creative industry undertakings in the form of clustering has been argued to be a possible mechanism to facilitate the growth of cultural and creative industries. Finally, the principles and methods to generate CCJQs using policy and planning methods are outlined in this section.\u00a0Tutorial: Draft a proposal aimed at transforming Hong Kong into a creative city.\u00a0\u00a010. Planning for Public Arts, Arts Amenities, and Cultural Facilities\u00a0Developing cultural facilities through urban planning and design is an integral part of culture-led urban development. This section examines the position of arts amenities in urban policies through various historical stages, as well as the transition from emphasizing arts amenity provision to cultural facilities in urban planning. The main content of this lecture is devoted to providing instruction with regard to the ways by which to plan for cultural facilities in cosmopolitan cities, with an outline of the main approaches, such as providing cultural facilities as per the related planning codes with complementary methods of survey, designing a hierarchical system of cultural facility provision, developing facilities of mixed-use, and engaging member of the community. The anti-planning approach to creating cultural spaces is also included, the core concern of which involves a flexibly use of public and community spaces and family-centered virtual media facilities. \u00a0Tutorial: Analyze the policies of Hong Kong\u2019s cultural and creative industries, and draft policy recommendations for creative industry development in Hong Kong.\u00a0\u00a011. Creating Cultural Quarters \u00a0Cultural quarters, rooted in post-Fordist economy, have become an integral part of urban regeneration regime, which represents a transition in urban cultural policies toward a more comprehensive stage. This section discusses the political and economic importance of cultural quarters, the rationale of clustering cultural activities and creative industry businesses, and the typology of cultural quarters. Students are also introduced to the strategies and principles for creating cultural quarters based on Roodhouse\u2019s writings in 2006. Urban design skills to enhance the robustness of buildings and create vibrant street spaces and pedestrian spaces are complemented to Roodhouse\u2019s principles. Possible solutions to control gentrification are also discussed using the case of Lace Market. The final part of this section presents the instructor\u2019s consultancy project for the West Kowloon Cultural District.\u00a0Tutorial: Come up with recommendations for improving cultural facilities in Hong Kong.\u00a0\u00a012. Heritage Conservation and Historic Urban Quarter Revitalization\u00a0The significance of historical buildings and urban heritage sites in making a creative urban creative milieu and the process of disseminating symbols through cultural consumption-led urban spaces have been covered by previous sections. In this section, students are introduced to the historical transition and developing tendency of historic buildings and heritage conservation from preserving individual buildings to area-based conservation. With a clarification of the meaning of historic quarters, this section focuses on the selection of appropriate approaches or strategies that can be used in revitalizing historic urban quarters. These methods include preservation and conservation controls as well as physical and economic revitalization based on the assessment of the type of obsoletion. \u00a0Tutorial: Consultancy report for a cultural district in Hong Kong\u00a0\u00a013. The Workshop: Making Culturally Reenergized Cities\u00a0In this section, the final group is expected to present their group project on historical quarter revitalization in Hong Kong. To wrap up this course, the final section summarizes all the key issues and points. Supplemental instructions are provided based on the progress of the students\u2019 group projects, after which all comments on each group\u2019s projects are synthesized. One or two mechanisms might be introduced to strengthen the students\u2019 capacity to apply the theories learned, such as the evaluation matrix for cultural quarters and historic building reuses. A Q&A section is then included to answer students\u2019 questions concerning the knowledge in this course. Moreover, additional supervision for individual group projects is provided as needed.", "required_readings": "Bell, D. and Jayne, M. 2004.

These applications address current societal concerns, needs, and the ever-changing culture both locally and globally. The relevance of cultural heritage is influenced by complex power structures, including its presentation and representation in contexts such as postcolonialism, racial dynamics, gender, intergenerational equity, disparities in access to technology, marginalization, and the tension between localism and globalization. Additionally, the modern application of cultural heritage is shaped by evolving economic structures and technological advancements. Heritage is increasingly utilized by creative industries, with its assets digitized, interpreted, and experienced through advanced technologies such as AI and VR. Ensuring the continued relevance of cultural heritage has become a critical issue.This course aims to provide students with an understanding of cultural heritage and its diverse modern applications, along with the critical concepts that shape our perception of its relevance today. It addresses issues concerning cultural heritage and its relationship with changing urban demographics, climate change, intergenerational equity, and the application of technologies for future alternatives. Additionally, the course explores cultural heritage as an economic generator, its role in performance, sports, and games, and its adoption in personalized tours and emerging cultural industries. Through a variety of concepts and case studies, students will gain multiple perspectives on current practices and reflect on the vast potential of cultural heritage in contemporary times.", "outcome": "Upon completion of the course, students would be able to: \u00a0 Explore key examples of cultural heritage and its diverse modern applications, along with the critical concepts that shape our perception of its relevance today.

The purposes of the course may be summarized as follows: 1. What are the various display methods in museums? What are the concerns involved in selecting the \u2018right\u2019 ones? 2. How are museum workers (non-curatorial) trained? 3. What are the essential facilities a museum is expected to have? Why? 4. What is the role of museum in the contemporary arts, which is the area of debate regarding its significance and curatorship? The course develops students\u2019 awareness towards global developments in world-class museums, so that they are equipped with skills and knowledge necessary for long-term competition in museums or other cultural institutions.", "outcome": "At the end of the course, students should be able to: \u00a01.

Oral Histories I\u00a0Not everything in the museum is tangible. In many cases, the objects are reminders of something unheard, unseen, or even almost forgotten.

We will test the usefulness of the training package as suggested by ICOM and reflect on its rationale to run the museum as incorporation. \u00a0UNESCO Running a Museum: A Practical Handbook, available online.\u00a011. Training II: museum non-curatorial workers\u00a0Curators are usually not the first person a visitor sees or gets in touch with in the museum. There are receptionists, volunteers, security guards, caretakers, cafe waiters, etc. These people are parts of the museum. Together their bonding represents the brand of the museum. This lecture will again use the ICOM package and check the training programmes suggested in there.\u00a0UNESCO Running a Museum: A Practical Handbook, available online.\u00a012. Museum Facilities \u00a0Cloakrooms, washrooms, disabled facilities, restaurants, and rest areas are essential in a museum nowadays. There is also the space outside the museum building.

We will first focus on this problematic by tracing a particular set of questions through which knowledge about Islam and Muslim politics has been produced. By reading excerpts from scholarly works and influential media outlets, by watching documentaries, and through discussions during the class, we will develop a framework in which to recognize, understand and appreciate the gamut of political predicaments that Islamic tradition and its practitioners face under modern conditions. By the end of the first half of this course, students are expected to develop the ability to engage the following questions: What kind of assumptions about Islam and politics inform popular discussions on this topic? How has the rise of modern state power shaped and reshaped Muslims\u2019 understanding of their tradition? What forms of lives, histories and struggles can and cannot be captured by this problematic? We will then spend the last several weeks exploring case studies that are considered to be paradigmatic of Islamic politics today. We will look at such historical and contemporary controversies as the Iraq War, the Arab Spring, the rise of ISIS, and the Jamal Khashoggi affair. In each given case, we will trace various ways in which the questions we addressed in the first half of the course continue to inhabit the narratives about how a supposedly \u201cauthentic\u201d Islam figures in Muslims\u2019 search for political and cultural legitimacy in modern times. Thus, the course does not aim so much to provide a survey of Muslims politics, but to develop a critical perspective on the key concepts and images that frame Muslims\u2019 and non-Muslims\u2019 discussions about the convergence between Islam and modern politics.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "3376", "title": "Religious Fundamentalism and Asian Cultures", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Cultural & Rel Studies", "requirements": "", "description": "This course aims to introduce the effects of religious fundamentalism on the politics of representation among various Asian cultures.
